<h1>What the CSS?</h1>
<p id="word">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the lauout of a webpage</p>
<p id="word1">With CSS, you can controlthe color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, hopw elements are positioned and laid out, what
    background images or background colors are to be used, different devices and screen sizes, anh much more!</p>
<p id="word2"><b>Tip:</b>The word <b>cascading</b>means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elments within the parent. So, if you
    set the color of the body text to "blue", all headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will also get the same color (unless you specify something elsse)
